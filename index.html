        The journey of mobile phones began in the mid-20th century with early wireless communication systems. In 1973, Martin Cooper of Motorola made history by making the first handheld mobile phone call using the DynaTac prototype. These devices were bulky, expensive, and had limited functionality, but they marked the start of a new era in communication technology. Over time, innovations in design and technology paved the way for mobile phones to become more practical and accessible. This breakthrough inspired further research and development in the telecommunications industry. It also demonstrated the potential for mobile devices to revolutionize human interaction. The invention of mobile phones was a turning point in how people communicated across distances.
